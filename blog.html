           Well... not completely. While there are no lecture videos posted and assignments cannot be due during reading week, it is traditionally used by students to catch up on classes they've fallen behind in or to finish up assignments with impeding deadlines. While the team at Rheo hasn't been doing too much reading other than looking into the occasional Vue/Bootstrap documentation, we've been hard at work on developing our product. 
        </p>
        <h5 class="display-7">Computer Vision</h5>
        <p class="lead">
          Device tracking has made significant improvements! Our devices are now able to track people moving across the field of view of the thermal sensors. This was done with background subtraction and blob detection on the ouput of the thermal sensor. The background subtraction was utilized to reduce noise and prepare the sensor data for blob detection. Blob detection was then run on the sensor data to find and track users walking across. From the location of where the first blob is located, a direction can also be derived. The following video shows the basic tracking capability of our devices.

        <h5 class="display-7">Front End</h5>
        <p class="lead">
          There are a couple of significant updates to our web interface. The first is the development of user accounts and authentication. Users will now be directed to the sign in page if they are not already logged in. Once they login successfully, they are able to access the full product and the spaces and data associated with their company. In addition to user accounts, a new settings page was also developed. This gives users the ability to change and update information about their account such as names, email addresses, and their password.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Another essential addition to the product is the development of the Configurations page. This is a core feature which allows users to add/modify/delete devices, spaces, and connections in their company. It essentially lets users model and set up their spaces so that our devices can start tracking occupancy and analyzing the data. The following video provides a sneak peek of these new features:

        <h5 class="display-7">Mechanical</h5>
        <p class="lead">
          We received confirmation for the competion of the 3D printing of our housing and picked up all the individual components this past week. During assembly however, we noticed that there were a couple of issues with the dimensions of the components. First, the material thickness is causing interference for components with tight tolerances causing them to not lock in with each other. Secondly, there is slight warping in the arm components and insufficient clearance for the wires to loop through the main body to the arms. As a result, we had to adjust some of the CAD for the housing and we'll be submitting a new print request shortly. Even though we weren't able to get things right the first time (re: Blog #2), we're optimisitc that we'll be able to build a prototype of the device before our demo given the short turnaround for the first print job. While the first housing didn't snap into place like we'd hope, it is amazing to see our devices taking shape. Here's a picture of prototype #0.5!
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col">

          </div>
        </p>
        <h5 class="display-7">Data</h5>
        <p class="lead">
          Given that development for the web client, backend, and devices are occuring in parallel, there is not enough data being generated from our sensors to accurately model the utilization of a commercial space. As a result, a data simulation script was written to generate realistic usage data for the purposes of development. If you revisit our last blog post, you'll notice that some of the utilization graphs on the historical page don't make the most sense for a room in a commercial space. The new data generation script models a small startup. As a result, there is one company created, 4 admin users created, and around 10 connected spaces with varying types and max occupancies. These spaces include two common areas, a large conference room, two smaller meeting rooms, one office, 2 restrooms, and a kitchen area. Once all the space data was generated, the events could be filled in. A configuration file was created for each room to model typical usage for that type of room. For example, a conference room would mostly be utilized in time slots of 30 minutes. In addition, it is likely for offices to be highly used during the weekdays and almost empty during weekends. In addition, during lunch times, meeting rooms are usually empty and employees congregate in the common spaces like the kitchen. All of these elements were used in generating realistic space utilization data for all the rooms for a given month.

        <p class="lead">
          The picture above shows the new utilization data that is generated. This will help the team immensely during development as well as for demoes while the actual devices are continually improved.
        </p>
        <h5 class="display-7">Next Steps</h5>
        <p class="lead">
          The focus of this week is to continue front end development. Specifically, the Gauge components for the realtime data elements on the home page as well as expanding the features on the Historical page are the goals for this week. In addition, the device computer vision tracking systems will be continually developed to work better in various environments and situations. Lastly, the data simulation script is being expanded to include realtime data generation for development purposes. That's it for this week! Stay tuned for more updates.

        <p class="lead">
          In light of our update was last week, which was largely comprised of a giant wall of text with some pictures sprinkled in, we've decided to take a different approach for our weekly update this week. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then surely a video is worth a thousand pictures. Regardless if the math checks out, the team at Rheo would like to present you a different perspective, one from our Rheo sensors!
          <div class="row">

          The first video shows a heat map of what our sensors are tracking. The majority of the background is a static shade of dark blue while a bright white blob darts across the screen as Naitao walks back and forth. This is in comparison to the reference video underneath which was captured with an optical camera. The benefit of thermal sensors now become evident as they block out irrelevent data and noise not essential for occupancy tracking. In addition, they allow for anonymous data collection which cannot be said for other sensor types like the optical camera. The use of a cardboard box as a curtain is quite ingenious! Now that we have the basic functionality of our devices set up, we can start to develop the detection and sensing ability under different environments to ensure highly accurate occupancy tracking.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          We've also been hard at work on our front end as well. The following video gives a current preview of a Historical page in the Rheo app. The purpose of the Historical page is to provide a visualization of specific room usage over time. Specifically, users will be able to see the occupancy patterns of various rooms over a specified time period. Using this data, insights can then be derived for overall space utilization with metrics including average occupancy, peak cycles, trends, and utilization rate where the resolution of these reported metrics can be customised on input.

        <h5 class="display-7">Other Updates</h5>
        <p class="lead">
          Here lies the updates that weren't able to be "videofied". We've received an update on the status on the 3D printing of our housing components. The 3D printing job has been accepted and a subset of the components as been completed! The rest we're delayed due to some revisions to the CAD models. We're now just waiting on the rest of the components to be finished. Once that occurs, we can begin assembly to create the first Rheo device prototype!
        </p>
        <h5 class="display-7">Next Steps</h5>
        <p class="lead">
          The focus of this week is largly a continuation of last weeks efforts in laying the foundation towards an end-to-end demo and minimum viable product for Rheo which we hope to have by our next advisor meeting. The details don't have to be flushed out, but the goal is to have all the major pieces in place and working (emphasis on working). Specifically, the device sensor and tracking systems will be continually improved. In addition, work to transmit the device data to our backend will commence. This is a major link in ensuring end-to-end completness. Next, front end development will continue. The Historical page shown above is just a very early iteration. It will be further developed along with the other major pages like the Homepage as well as the Configure page. Furthermore, planning will start on the Analytics page. Lastly, as stated in the last blog post, any database and/or API changes required to support the front end work, is ongoing and planned for. That brings us to the end of this weeks updates. We hope you stay safe and healthy and as always, thank you for your continued interest in Rheo. We hope to see you next week :).

        <p class="lead">
            The team at Rheo has made some large strides this week in getting closer to a minimum viable product. Given that everything is online this term, maintaining proper channels for communication has been an integral part of our progress. The team meets biweekly to update each other on ongoing tasks as well as plan and prioritize for next steps. In addition, all work is tracked through Asana so any dependencies and blockers can be identified and addressed efficiently. The main areas of focus for this week included developing the core of the client API, starting the housing manufacturing process, and building out the computer vision algorithms for occupancy tracking.

        <h5 class="display-7">Hardware</h5>
        <p class="lead">
          The CAD renders for the device outer housing have been cleaned up and a WATiMake service order has been submitted. And now we wait... Given the current restrictions in place, WATiMake is only open on Monday, Wednesdays, and Fridays so there's a good chance that there's a large backlog of orders that have been placed from other students and FYDP groups. Stay tuned for any updates about the status of our order. In the meantime however, a render of our device is the best option we have:
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col">

            </div>
          </div>
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Thanks, we think they look pretty slick too (shoutout to our resident Mechanical Design lead Derek). The following render provides an exploded view of our Rheo devices along with the main components and separate pieces of the main housing:
          <div class="col">
            <img src="./static/device-component-breakdown.PNG" class="img-thumbnail">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption">Rheo Device Render - Exploded Component View</figcaption>
          </div>  
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          The housing uses an enclosed box design to maintain simplicity while making efficient use of internal space to house the hardware. The bottom housing a flat plate with mounting points for the Raspberry Pi and thermal sensor, as well as a cutout for the sensor. The inner side of the shell sits flush with both the top and bottom house and uses a small lip to lock them in place. 

          The purpose of the arm is to attach the main housing to the mounting solution. It also helps to orient the housing downwards and keeps it away from the wall so that the sensor is not obstructed. It has a circular cutout that aligns with the top housing to allow for cable passthrough and has a corresponding cutout on top for the cable to exit. 
        </p>
        <h5 class="display-7">Software</h5>
        <p class="lead">
          On the software side of things, the client API is starting to take shape. Preliminary endpoints including creation, deletion, and simple querying of objects in our database have been written. A simplified data schema is presented in the following picture:

          <div class="col">
            <img src="./static/schema.PNG" class="img-thumbnail">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption">Rheo Database Schema - Simplified</figcaption>
          </div>  
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          These endpoints provide the foundation for more complex functions that contain business logic which can now start to be developed. An example is the realtime data endpoint which returns the current occupancy of a given space along with the current trend of the space. This endpoint was just finished and is currently in the process of being tested with mock data. 
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Lastly we have computer vision. The team has been looking into different methods of detecting crowd flow through the thermal sensor output data. Some algorithms being considered are blob detection, object tracking, as well as background subtraction. Each one of these algorithms will be evaluated on accuracy and performance. 
        </p>
        <h5 class="display-7">Next Steps</h5>
        <p class="lead">
          The priority for the team this week is computer vision and the web interface. These are the last crucial missing pieces of the pipeline which are needed to complete the end-to-end demo of Rheo's product. Specifically, we hope to have a working device prototype that can accurately (to our specifications) track the occupancy of one space with a single door. As for the front end client, we hope to have a couple of pages with some of the basic elements of our product. Lastly, the backend API which connects all the separate components is continously being extended as the other parts are worked on. That brings us to the end of this weeks updates, thanks for sticking with us and please stay tuned for more exciting updates next week! (perhaps a video! :3)

            We're three weeks into the Winter term and courses have started to ramp up which only means that deadlines are coming! On the bright side, Winter Solstice just passed so the days only gets brighter from here. The team has been working hard towards developing a functional end to end solution for Rheo. This past week we had our first advisor meeting with Prof. Tung and Prof. Kennings where we gave a brief update. Some key takeaways from that meeting include putting a priority on finding a way to 3D print our device housing given the current circumstances and developing a minimum viable product that can be demoed at the next meeting in around a month.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            As for member specific updates, Naitao has been leading the research and development of the computer vision algorithms on the device for occupancy detection. In addition, Derek has been finalizing our CAD models in preparation for 3D printing (We're trying to get things right on the first try). He has also been working to finalize the interface between the devices and our backend which invovles implementing the data transfer schema in which data is being sent by the devices to our backend to be processed and stored. Lastly, Jason and Mulan have been working on the client product which includes the backend API and web application. API specifications are being worked out and basic pages are being developed.

        <p class="lead">
            It's been a whirlwind 2020 and we have all been looking forward to 2021! This week we met up to discuss progress 
            made since the end of MTE 481 and over the winter break. 
            We have made leaps and bounds in terms of getting infrastructure and base functionality for our backend server, 
            hosting services, and individual raspberry pi device servers. 
            
            In terms of our backend infrastructure, we established basic functions including an operational web server and API endpoints, 
            as well as the database schema that will be used for our final product.
            
            We configured our webapp to function on a hosted amazon EC2 instance and ensured that 
            it could be remotely accessed as well as adequately secured.
            
            Lastly, we setup the raspberry pi local server including some basic data management functionality. 
            We also received all the ordered parts needed to the physical devices and established a working thermal sensor 
            with data output to the pi.
